# A model-free mechanism of observational social learning?
We build on prior research that shows signatures of “model-free” learning and decision-making in humans.  We interrogate the possibility of an analogous mechanism of observational learning.  The key property of model-free learning is that actions are reinforced proportional to their history of reward, without taking into account an explicit model of causal dynamics that lead to that reward.  We ask whether actions are also reinforced in proportion to the observed history of reward realized by others.
