# Social model-free learning
This repository contains data and code for the "Social model-free learning in sequential choice tasks" by Tom Osborn and Fiery Cushman. In this project, we aim to show the presence of social model-free learning in traditional sequential choice tasks. This kind of learning occurs when agents complete these tasks collaboratively with social agents. Like in the traditional dual-system decision-making task, social model-free learning involves the construction of a look-up table by an agent when the agent is observing other social agents, and using this table to quickly calculate utilities that are used to update the agentâ€™s knowledge base and guide future decision-making; a reward prediction error is computed. Thus, it is a reward specific type of learning in which observed actions are that are positively rewarded are reinforced and repeated.
