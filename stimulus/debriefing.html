	<p>
		You have now completed this HIT.
	</p>
	<p>
        The task that you played is used to study social influence on decision making. Some decisions are purely made from habit, whereas other decisions are the result of more deliberate planning. This task was designed to distinguish between these two types of decision making 
        and to understand how social environments impact decisions. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Using mathematical models, we can infer to what degree you used planning and habit during this task. We are trying to test whether planning makes it more likely to get reward in this task and if other people's planning habits influence others.
