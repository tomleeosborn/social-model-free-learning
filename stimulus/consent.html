		Please consider this information carefully before deciding whether to participate in this research.
	</p>
	<p>
		The purpose of this research is to examine which factors influence decision-making. You will be asked to make judgments about individuals and actions in social scenarios. We are simply interested in your judgment. The study will take approximately 45 minutes to complete, and you will receive $4.50 on Amazon Mechanical Turk. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study.  The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would ordinarily experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a mouse or keyboard for a similar amount of time. At the end of the study, we will provide an explanation of the questions that motivate this line of research and will describe the potential implications.
